This is a general scheduling framework written in Java. It was developed at CERN to schedule hardware tests.

It is able to schedule many items using constraints written in Java. It is therefore trying to solve the CSP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) for scheduling tasks.
